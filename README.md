# Unit-5-Public-API-Requests
 Using API's to create an employee directory

In project, I used data from an API resource to create an employee directory. 
Using javascript, I was able to create a card for each employee using said data and open up its
appropriate modal window when clicked. 

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

Using an API resource was very different than using a resource provided in the JS file itself. 
I had to think about the API data differently and learned that I can grab data by jumping from function to function. 

## CSS Changes
changed background color to body, .card, and .modal-container 
made .card div larger when user hovers over it

## Attributes
background color gradient was gotten from this website: https://palettes.shecodes.io/palettes/1313 and https://gradients.shecodes.io/
